Here are some results from the ImageNet and COCO dataset. The model generated glimpse where foveal vision is visualized by a red rectangular, peripheral vision is visualized by a yellow rectangular. It's possible to know which area crops the model are used for prediction. From the result, we obsearve that the model did focus on the object in ImageNet and COCO dataset, that are highly task-related, providing a unique interpretability of hard attention than other models.
